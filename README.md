# PhysicsExpo
Serious game based on interactive science exhibits and laboratories to explore alternate physics theories and devices. In particular, Konstantin Meyl's [Equation of Objectivity](https://www.meyl.eu/) and Kevin Orlowski's [Magnetic Energy](https://magneticenergyfuture.com/). This work is based on an Ontology, which basically means the analysis and synthesis of all the concepts in a domain and the relationships between the concepts. The game consists of a museum of science and technology with theory exhibits and device exhibits, much like a World Fair. There will also be laboratories where the concepts learned from the exhibits can be applied in experiments. The game is released as fully open source with a highly permissive MIT license. The project is dedicated to Michael Tellinger's Ubuntu initiative (One Small Town).
