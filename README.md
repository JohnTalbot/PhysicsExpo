# PhysicsExpo
Serious game based on interactive science exhibits and laboratories to explore alternate physics theories and devices. In particular, Konstantin Meyl's [Equation of Objectivity](https://www.meyl.eu/) and Kevin Orlowski's [Magnetic Energy](https://magneticenergyfuture.com/). The hidden technology of scalar waves and their applications has been revealed by Steven Greer's [Disclosure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDY7t6HihCw) movement. The current work is based on an [Ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology), which basically means the analysis and synthesis of all the concepts in a domain and the relationships between the concepts. The game consists of a museum of science and technology with theory exhibits and device exhibits, much like a World Fair. There will also be laboratories where the concepts learned from the exhibits can be applied in experiments. The game is released as fully open source with a highly permissive [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). The project is dedicated to Michael Tellinger's [Ubuntu initiative](https://michaeltellinger.com/ubuntu/) One Small Town.
